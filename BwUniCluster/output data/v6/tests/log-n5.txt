*** The MPI_Waitall() function was called after MPI_FINALIZE was invoked.
*** This is disallowed by the MPI standard.
*** Your MPI job will now abort.
[uc2n361.localdomain:147336] Local abort after MPI_FINALIZE started completed successfully, but am not able to aggregate error messages, and not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[39050,1],0]
  Exit code:    1
