This directory contains different versions of the prototype, as
they have been used and enhanced over time

The script can be run using GNU octave https://octave.org/
Example images for each version are also available in the respective directory

The alignment-test demonstrates how noise distributions scaled with an
unknown factor can be glued together based on a model

Details can be found in my final thesis

The lines of code show the continuous development of the prototype:

  LOC file
---------------------------
  167 prototype_version_1.m
  267 prototype_version_2.m
  568 prototype_version_3.m
  547 prototype_version_4.m
  839 prototype_version_5.m
---------------------------
 2388 prototype
  250 alignment-test.m
---------------------------
 2638 overall

However note that these are prototype scripts and code quality was
therefore a minor concern. Also it is mixed language between german and
english and the technical terms might not have been used correctly.

This is intended as archivation and documentation of the work that was
done and not for further use. Therefore the code has not been thoroughly
commented and the readability is improveable.
